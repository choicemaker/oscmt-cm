      <td colspan="7">ChoiceMaker software finds duplicate records
      in a database.&nbsp; The figure below depicts
      how ChoiceMaker software works, by showing three examples
      of how ChoiceMaker might compare two records.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In Example 1, the information in the records is closely
      similar, although not identical. The degree of similarty is
      high enough that ChoiceMaker software assigns the records a
      match probability of 93 percent, and on that basis, some
      customer application merges the records to eliminate the
      duplication.<br>
      <br>
      In Example 2, there is little similarity between the records,
      so ChoiceMaker assigns a low match probability of just 12
      percent, and the records are kept as distinct entries in the
      database.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, in Example 3, it is not clear whether the records
      represent the same person, particularly if there's a chance
      that some of the data might be erroneous or
      out-of-date.&nbsp; ChoiceMaker assigns an intermediate match
      probability to these pairs, so that the customer application
      can hold them aside for further human review.</td>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="7">Consider a registry of children that is
      maintained by a state or local government.&nbsp; Such a
      registry might be an immunization database that tracks
      inoculations or a student database that tracks academic
      records across school districts.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of an immunization registry, it is important to
      avoid duplicate records for children so that each child
      receives a complete set of inoculations.&nbsp; In the case of
      a state-wide student registry, it is important to avoid
      duplicates so that the state can comply with the mandates of
      the federal No Child Left Behind Act.<br></td>

    <tr>
      <td colspan="7">
        It can be difficult to find duplicates in a database.&nbsp;
        Again, consider the case of children.&nbsp; Social security
        numbers for children, particularly for young children, tend
        to be unreliable.&nbsp; Other important information about a
        child -- such as the child's first, middle or last name, or
        the child's home address or phone number -- can change over
        time.&nbsp; Even information that shouldn't change -- such
        the child's birth date -- may be missing or
        unreliable.&nbsp; In fact, any data entered for a child may
        contain errors, non-standard spellings or placeholder
        values.<br>
        <br>
        Even when errors and incomplete or ambiguous data are
        present, human beings usually have a reliable intuition for
        whether two database records match each other.&nbsp; That's
        because human beings can consider information in context,
        and factor out unimportant differences or similarities
        between records.&nbsp; In the case of personnel records,
        humans recognize that "Jim" and "James" are nicknames; that
        "Keanu Reeves" and "Reaves, Keenu" might be the same person
        with first and last name swapped and slightly misspelled;
        and that two persons named "Maria Garcia" with a common
        birthdate of "1/1/2001" might not be a particularly strong
        match to each other, because the names are not uncommon and
        the birthdates look like approximations.<br>
        <br>
        ChoiceMaker software works by mimicking human
        intuition.&nbsp; It does this in a straightforward
        way.&nbsp; The software compares two records at a
        time.&nbsp; For each field in the pair of records, the
        software applies simple true or false tests, called
        <i>clues</i>, to check whether the field values point
        toward a match.&nbsp; For example, in the case of first
        names, the following tests might be applied:<br>
        <br>
        Match clues:<br>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">Do the values of the two records match each other
          exactly?</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">Do the values match each other phonetically?</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">Do the values match each other if a few letters are
          transposed?</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">Are the values nicknames for each other?</li>
        </ul>Differ clues:<br>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">Are the values completely different?</li>
        </ul>Hold clues (insufficient information)<br>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">Is one (or both) of the values missing, invalid or a
          placeholder?<br></li>
        </ul>A collection of such clues are applied together as
        part of a single <i>model</i> for whether records
        match.&nbsp; In a realistic, high-accuracy model, there
        might be hundreds of such clues for dozens of field
        values.<br>
        <br>
        After all the clues are evaluated for a pair of records,
        ChoiceMaker combines the results into an overall
        probability score.&nbsp; It does this by assigning each
        clue a numerical <i>weight</i> that indicates its relative
        significance in the probability calculation.

      <td colspan="7">
        The magic of ChoiceMaker software is in the weights that it
        assigns to clues.&nbsp; ChoiceMaker uses a patented
        method to compute clue weights so that ChoiceMaker probabilities
        mimic human intuition.&nbsp; Data experts are asked to review a set of
        record pairs, and for each pair, they are asked to mark
        down one of three decisions:<br>

        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none">Do the pairs match each
          other (a <i>match</i> decision)?</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">Are different from each
          other (a <i>differ</i> decision)?</li>

          <li style="list-style: none">Is there not enough
          information to decide (a <i>hold</i> decision)?</li>

        </ul>Using a machine-learning algorithm such as maximum
        entropy, ChoiceMaker software determines the clue weights
        that best reproduce the experts' decisions.&nbsp; 
        This process is called <i>training</i> a
        model.&nbsp; When a trained model is subsequently applied
        to completely different pairs, one finds that ChoiceMaker
        probabilities closely predict how a data expert would mark
        the new pairs.<br>

      things.&nbsp; ChoiceMaker software can help with almost any
      collection of structured data.&nbsp; If human beings can tell
      the difference between duplicates, ChoiceMaker software can
      be trained to mimic their decisions.<br></td>
