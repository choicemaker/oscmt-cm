      <td colspan="7">ChoiceMaker models are developed and refined
      iteratively.&nbsp; A model developer begins by writing some
      clues that indicate what data correlations between records
      point toward match, hold or differ decisions.&nbsp; Next, the
      candidate clues are trained against a set of record pairs
      (the <i>training set</i>) that have been marked by one or
      more data experts.&nbsp; Finally, the new clue weights are
      tested against a different set of record pairs (the <i>test
      set</i>) that have also been marked by data experts.<br>
      <br>
      This iterative process continues until the model under
      development achieves a satisfactory accuracy (compared to
      human markings) on the test pairs.&nbsp; Once the accuracy is
      adequate, the model is ready to be deployed in a production
      application or to a production server.<br>

      <td colspan="7">A critical part of the ChoiceMaker modeling
      process is the development of appropriate clues.&nbsp; An
      equally critical part is the selection of good pairs for
      training and testing.<br>
      <br>
      What constitutes good pairs for training and testing?&nbsp;
      First and foremost, the pairs used for training and testing
      should be distinct.&nbsp; A pair that is used for training
      should not be used for testing.&nbsp; Also, a pair that is
      used for training or for testing should be used only
      once.&nbsp; Second, pairs that are used for either training
      or testing should be relatively ambiguous.&nbsp; The accuracy
      of a ChoiceMaker model compared to human intuition is
      generally not improved by including a bunch of pairs that are
      obvious matches (in which all fields agree exactly) or
      obvious holds (in which all fields are missing or invalid) or
      obvious differs (in which all fields are completely
      different).<br>
      <br>
      How does one find good pairs?&nbsp; There are several
      ChoiceMaker tools that will comb through a database of
      (single) records and pull out pairs of records with ambiguous
      ChoiceMaker probabilities.&nbsp; Typically, these tools use
      the same ChoiceMaker model that is under development to find
      pairs that score ambiguously under that model.&nbsp; Human
      data experts then review the new pairs, and mark the pairs as
      matches, holds and differs.&nbsp; Early in the development
      process, pairs that score ambiguously to the nascent model
      typically do not appear at all ambiguous to human reviewers,
      so when the model is trained against the newly marked pairs,
      the model weights move toward values that push pair
      probabilities toward less ambiguous scores.&nbsp; As the
      iterative process continues, human markings and ChoiceMaker
      probabilities begin to coalesce.<br></td>
