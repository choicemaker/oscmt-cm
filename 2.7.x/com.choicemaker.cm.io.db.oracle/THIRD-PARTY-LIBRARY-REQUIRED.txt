This plug-in requires the classes12.jar JDBC library from Oracle.
Please download the library and install it in the lib subdirectory.

Recommended version: 10.2.0.4
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_10201.html

Older version may use the ".zip" extensions. If they are used, the plugin.xml configuration
file needs to be modified to refer to "lib/classes12.zip" instead of "lib/classes12.jar."
