Provides basic support for launching the Eclipse Platform.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The Eclipse Platform makes heavy use of Java class loaders for loading
plug-ins. Even the Platform Core Runtime itself, including the <tt>Platform</tt>
class, needs to be loaded by a special class loader. The upshot is that
a client program (such as a Java main program, a servlet) cannot directly
reference even the <tt>Platform</tt> class. Instead, a client must use
a boot loader (provided here) for initializing the platform, invoking functionality
defined in plug-ins, and shutting down the platform when done.
