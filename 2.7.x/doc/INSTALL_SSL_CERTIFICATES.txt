ChoiceMaker Maven builds use a Nexus server at
  https://dev.choicemaker.com:8443

The SSL certificates for this server are currently
issued by StartCom LLC. While these certificates
are handled automatically by browsers such as Firefox,
Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, they are not
recognized as valid by the Java 1.7 and 1.8 runtime
environment. In order for them to be recognized as
valid, certificates for StartCom LLC must be added
to the global keystore for Java 1.7 and 1.8.

Under Linux and Mac OS X, there are scripts in the
top-level src directory that install the StartCom
LLC certificates in the global keystore.

Under Windows, it may be possible to run one of the
scripts under Cygwin, although this has not been tested.

More documentation is available in the script themselves
and at
  "Java and the StartSSL CA certificates"
