/**
 * This exception is thrown by the URM API if
 * an UnderspecifiedQueryException is thrown during
 * a method that invokes the Online Automated Blocking Algorithm.
 * Underspecified queries are user-correctable problems. As an
 * example, they can be caused by user asking ChoiceMaker to a
 * person with the last name of Smith if the database has many
 * records with this last name. The problem can be corrected by
 * refining the query; for example, by asking for records matching
 * Raymond Smith in the 10021 zip code.
 * <p>
 * This exception helps decouple the URM from the classes used
 * to implement the URM.
