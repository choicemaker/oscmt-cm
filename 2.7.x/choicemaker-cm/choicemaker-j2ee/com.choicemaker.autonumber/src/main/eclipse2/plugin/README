This plugin is based on the org.jboss.varia.autonumber package, which is
distributed under terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This plugin
is distributed under the same terms.

The purpose of this plugin is to make available AutoNumber functionality in
a consistent manner independent of whatever Java application server the
plugin is used within. There are several minor modifications to the orginal package:

 (1) The package name has been changed from "org.jboss.varia.autonumber"
     to "com.choicemaker.autonumber," in order to avoid name conflicts
      when used within the JBoss app server.

 (2) log4j is used in place of jboss logging
 
 (3) The JNDI name in the java:comp/env namespace has been changed
     to java:comp/env/ejb/entity/AutoNumber
     
  (4) Get and Set methods were added to the AutoNumber interface for the
     name attribute, since the Oracle Toplink persistence manager requires
     a non-read-only accessor for the primary key of a CMP 2.x entity bean.

To use this package, the AutoNumber EJB must be deployed within an application
server. Please write deployment guides for JBoss, Oracle OC4J, Weblogic and
other app servers as CM Server is deployed to these platforms.
