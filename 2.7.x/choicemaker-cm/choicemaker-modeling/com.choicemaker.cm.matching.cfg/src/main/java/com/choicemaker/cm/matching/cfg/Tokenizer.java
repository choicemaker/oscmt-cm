/**
 * The Tokenizer interface defines the two basic methods 
 * for tokenizing a input String or Strings.
 * 
 * Tokenization is the first step in name and address
 * parsing.  The task is to split a String into its constituent
 * pieces.
 * 
 * The Tokenizer interface provides two methods for tokenizing
 * an input argument or arguments.  The first takes a single String,
 * as names and addresses are often reported as a single field.
 * The other takes an array of Strings, as names and addresses 
 * are also sometimes entered as multiple fields, for example
 * first, middle, and last names.
 * 
 * In general, <code>tokenize(String[1])</code> and 
 * <code>tokenize(String)</code> should return equivalent Lists,
 * but this needn't be the case.
