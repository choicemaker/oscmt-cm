/**
 * Represents a symbol in a context-free grammar.  Symbols 
 * include Variables, which can be used in the grammar's rules,
 * and Tokens, which represent the actual pieces of the name 
 * or address to be parsed.  Note that only the Variable and Token
 * classes may subclass Symbol directly.  Classes that violate 
 * this may cause unexpected behavior.
 * 
 * Some Variables are also TokenTypes, each of which corresponds
 * to a particular type of Token, e.g. numbers, letters, street
 * suffixes, etc.
 * 
 * For this implementation of CFG's, Tokens never appear in Rules
 * added directly to the grammar.  However, they may be included
 * in special "leaf" (or terminal) Rules of the form
 * 
 *     TokenType --> Token
 *  
 * in which a TokenType goes to *exactly one* Token.  This is also
 * the only form of rule for which TokenTypes are allowed to be 
 * on the left-hand side.
 * 
 * Since Tokens may not appear in rules that are added to grammars,
 * TokenType Variables may not appear on the left-hand side of 
 * Rules in a CFG.
