/**
 * Provides access to the clue set and other generated features.
 * <p>
 * This interface is implemented by the generated accessor class, which
 * also implements the translator accessor interfaces of the configured
 * I/O components.
 * <p>
 * Access to the <code>ClueSet</code> goes through this interface for two reasons.
 * First, the implementing class can decide whether to create a new
 * <code>ClueSet</code> for each call or always return the same singleton. The
 * former is useful if a <code>ClueSet</code> caches data in fields and is not
 * thread safe.
 * <p>
 * Second, this design simplifies the reloading of modified generated
 * classes into the same virtual machine during training.
