<BODY>
An object pooling framework.

Every error message shown by the pool framework can displayed in
a different language.  Simply add a new resource 
(named <TT>com/protomatter/pool/Resources</TT>) to your classpath
for the new language.  For instance, to add French error
messages, you would copy the existing file
<TT><a href="Resources.properties">com/protomatter/pool/Resources.properties</A></TT>
and make a new file called
<TT>com/protomatter/pool/Resources_fr.properties</TT>
and place it in the <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>.  Please see the
JavaDoc for the <TT>java.util.ResourceBundle</TT> class
for more information.
