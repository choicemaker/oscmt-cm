Syslog is a system-wide logging facility.  It's roughly based on the
UNIX syslog facility, but has many nice features not found there.
It provides a clean, uniform interface for sending log messages and
a modular back-end for writing entries to files, databases, etc.<P>

The main class that other programs interact with is the
<tt>{@link com.protomatter.syslog.Syslog Syslog}</tt> class.
Everything on the class is static, making 
it easy to interact with as a service.  The
<tt>{@link com.protomatter.syslog.Channel Channel}</tt> class
is a simplified, "federated namespace" interface for sending
messages.
<P>

Messages sent to Syslog are handled by objects implementing the
<tt>Syslogger</tt> interface.  Syslog provides the concept of
levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and FATAL).  Individual loggers
can have their own log policies for deciding if they should
pay attention to given log message.  There is a useful default
policy that allows loggers to only listen to certain channels or
messages at certain levels, etc.<P>

Syslog provides startup classes for both the
<a href="http://www.bea.com">BEA WebLogic Server</a>
Application Server, and for Protomatter's own PAS Application Server.
This allows for easy configuration of the <tt>Syslog</tt> package
when each application server starts.<P>

Please refer to the <a href="syslog-whitepaper.html">Syslog Whitepaper</a>
the JavaDoc for the {@link com.protomatter.syslog.Syslog Syslog}
class for more information on usage.<P>

For information on configuring Syslog via an XML file, please refer
to JavaDoc for the
<tt>{@link com.protomatter.syslog.xml.SyslogXML SyslogXML}</tt> class.<P>

Every error message can displayed in
a different language.  Simply add a new resource 
(named <TT>com/protomatter/syslog/Syslog</TT>) to your classpath
for the new language.  For instance, to add French error
messages, you would copy the existing file
<TT><a href="Syslog.properties">com/protomatter/syslog/Syslog.properties</A></TT>
and make a new file called
<TT>com/protomatter/syslog/Syslog_fr.properties</TT>
and place it in the <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>.  Please see the
JavaDoc for the <TT>java.util.ResourceBundle</TT> class
for more information.
