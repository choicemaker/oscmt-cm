   Defines the architecture of ChoiceMaker functional modules.
  <p>
  ChoiceMaker operational modules (e.g. ModelTraining, ModelEvaluation, HumanReview)
  were initially built around a consistent but informal structure, namely <ul>
  <li/> Each module provided a distinct set of operations
  <li/> Module operations usually emitted events, and in turn, modules often listened for
  the events by other modules.
  <li/> Modules often had an implicit concept of state, in which they changed state in
  response to events they or other modules emitted
  <li/> Modules could be configured by changing certain properties
  <li/> Modules optionally provided status messages to the user as they performed
  their operations
  <li/> And finally, and most obviously, modules managed a chunk of screen real estate
  whereby the user control the module and the module would display results to the user.
  These chunks of real estate were generally implemented as Swing JPanel classes.
  </ul>
  These structural concepts were not enforced in the initial design. One goal of refactoring
  ChoiceMaker is to enforce this architecture so that the monolithic
  ModelMaker and XxxPanel classes (such as HumanReviewPanel) can be broken apart
  into domain classes and UI classes. This should allow the domain classes to be simplified
  and made useable in other contexts, such as porting applications to Swing or reusing
  domain objects (such as pair filtering) in Server components. It is also intended to
  provide a useful template for third-party developers to develop new modules for the
  ChoiceMaker matching framework</p>
