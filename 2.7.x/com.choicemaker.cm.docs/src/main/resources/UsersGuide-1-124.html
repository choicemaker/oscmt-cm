6	 The Review View
<a name="wp9002842"> </a></h3>
<p >
The Review view is where the user makes decisions on whether pairs of records match, differ, or should be held for further review.  As discussed above, it can be reached from the Overview or Search views by double-clicking on a record or clicking &quot;Review Selection&quot; or it can be reached directly from the menu bar by choosing <b>View</b><b>-></b><b>Overview.</b>
<a name="wp9002843"> </a></p>
<p >
<a href="UsersGuide-1-127.html#wp9002864"></a>shows an example Review screen.  In this example, ChoiceMaker has retrieved two records from the database that match the queued record, &quot;Michael Ancrum, born 5/4/1996&quot;.  The Review screen always displays the queued record in blue at the top of each table, while the matching record from the database is on the bottom in blue (in ClueMaker the queued record would be denoted as the q record, while the database record would be m).  Clicking on the tabs labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, etc. enables the user to switch between the different m records.  Make your decision on whether the records match or not by clicking the Match, Hold, or Differ radio buttons.  
<a name="wp9002844"> </a></p>
<p >
The lower part of the screen is where the data is displayed.  This section of the screen displays all the data in a very flexible and intuitive interface that is completely under the user's control.  The user can set up the different nodes in the database in multiple tables, showing the fields he/she wants, can set the column widths as desired, and can set up multiple tabbed views as shown in <a href="UsersGuide-1-127.html#wp9002864"></a> where one tab displays &quot;raw&quot; input data and a second tab shows derived fields, such as, perhaps, normalized addresses.  Further details on setting up and viewing data layouts can be found in <a href="UsersGuide-1-018.html#wp9001681">Chapter II</a>.  This data section of the screen works exactly the same as the ModelMaker functionality discussed in that section except that, by default the layout is not editable.  Before making any changes to the layout (inserting new tables, widening columns, etc.) you need to click on <font ><b>Layout</b></font><font  face="Wingdings"><b>à</b></font><font ><b>Review/Search</b></font><font  face="Wingdings"><b>à</b></font><font ><b>Layout Editable</b></font>.

<p >
<a href="UsersGuide-1-124.html#wp9002849">Figure 78</a> shows the same screen after the user has clicked on the &quot;B&quot; tab.  Note that the Review screen requires you to click on every match before any decisions can be accepted, so the &quot;Accept Review&quot; button is now no longer grayed out.

<p >
The buttons at the top of the screen perform the obvious functions.  <b>Accept Review</b> accepts the current decisions and sends them to the ChoiceMaker server to trigger the corresponding actions (for instance a <b>Match </b>decision would likely result in the two records being linked).  <b>Accept Review</b> also removes the record from the queue, although it may remain visible in <b>Overview</b> until <b>Refresh</b> on that screen is clicked.  <b>Skip Case</b> simply skips over the current queued record and goes to the next one in the queue.  <b>Reset Case</b> sets all decisions to the decisions computed by the ChoiceMaker decision-engine.  These are the decisions which are displayed when a record is first brought up in <b>Review</b>.    <b>Get Next Record From</b> shows which queue Review is currently retrieving records from, the order in which they are currently sorted in <b>Overview</b>, the records retrieved by <b>Search</b>, or the default <b>Queue</b>.  <b>Get Next Record From</b> allows you to switch from one queue to another by clicking on the queue box.
