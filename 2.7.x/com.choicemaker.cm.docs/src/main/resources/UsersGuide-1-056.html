7	 Rules
<a name="wp9002111"> </a></h3>
<p >
ClueMaker can also be used to write rules. Rules can be used to override the probabilistic decision in special cases. The syntax of a rule is similar to that of a clue. The keyword <em>rule</em> is used in place of <em>clue</em>. In addition to <em>differ</em>, <em>match</em>, and <em>hold</em>, <em>rules</em> can use one of the pseudo decisions <em>nomatch</em>, <em>nodiffer</em>, <em>nohold</em>, and <em>none</em>.
<a name="wp9002112"> </a></p>
<p >
If a rule with decision <em>differ</em>, <em>match</em>, or <em>hold</em> fires on a pair, the ChoiceMaker decision is <em>differ</em>, <em>match</em>, or <em>hold</em>, respectively, independent of the probabilistic decision (the decision based on the match probability and the thresholds). If a rule with pseudo decision <em>nomatch</em> fires on a pair, the ChoiceMaker decision is <em>hold</em> if the probabilistic decision is <em>hold</em> or <em>match</em> and <em>differ</em> otherwise. If a rule with pseudo decision <em>nodiffer</em> fires on a pair, the ChoiceMaker decision is <em>hold</em> if the probabilistic decision is <em>hold</em> or <em>differ</em> and <em>match</em> otherwise. If a rule with pseudo decision <em>nohold</em> fires on a pair, the ChoiceMaker decision is <em>differ</em> if the probabilistic decision is <em>hold</em> or <em>differ</em> and <em>match</em> otherwise.
<a name="wp9002113"> </a></p>
<p >
A rule with pseudo decision <em>none</em> does not affect or reinforce the decision. It is meant to be used in conjunction with one of the modifiers <em>note</em> or <em>report</em> for reporting without affecting the decision or for selection of pairs in ChoiceMaker ModelMaker.

<p >
<a href="UsersGuide-1-056.html#wp9002116">Figure 53</a> summarizes what decision is reported by ChoiceMaker based on the probabilistic decision and the rule's decision.

<p >
If multiple rules with decisions other than <em>none</em> activate on a given record pair, we distinguish two cases. If all rules with decisions other than <em>none</em> produce the same decision, then this consensus decision is the final decision. Otherwise, the final decision is <em>hold</em>.
<a name="wp9002117"> </a></p>
<p >
All rules must have decisions and be of type boolean, regardless of the type of the clue set.
<a name="wp9002118"> </a></p>
<p >
Rules can also be used as (temporary) replacements of decisive clues for which not enough supporting training data is available. For example, we might consider one person having first name `TWIN-A' and the other `TWIN-B' a strong indication that they are not the same person. Yet, our training data might not contain any, or just very few such cases. Thus, it is impossible to train such a clue-at least until more training data becomes available. We can, however, create a <em>nomatch</em> rule with the corresponding predicate.
<a name="wp9002119"> </a></p>
<p >
If the business rules corresponding to the rules have been used to human mark the pairs, it is advisable to add a <em>differ</em> clue with the same expression for each <em>differ</em> rule and vice versa for <em>match</em> clues. Additionally, <em>differ</em> clues may be introduced for <em>nomatch</em> rules and <em>match</em> clues for <em>nodiffer</em> clues. This may produce a more accurate probabilistic model. Alternatively, pairs on which rules fire may be removed from the training source

<p >
For example in <a href="UsersGuide-1-056.html#wp9002122">Figure 54</a>, we might not want to automatically call a match between two records if one of them is missing crucial data (is &quot;scanty&quot;). This is illustrated by rule <em>rScanty</em> (lines 2 - 4). Similarly, we might want to report if we have performed second pass matching against a record that has more than 3 stacked addresses, as shown by <em>rHighlyStacked</em> (lines 6 - 9).
